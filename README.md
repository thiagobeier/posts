New and all Posts from my blog.

**What am I doing?**

-   I am publishing my findings through tests, lessons learned and skills development around Azure, M365 and Server Infrastructure Services.

-   This GitHub repository helps me to organize some scripts and skills that I've been developed.

-   Within this repository there will be lab guides in PDF format, PowerShell scripts, VBS scripts and customization files such as JSON files, XML files and so on and so forth.

**Feedback**

Please use the Issues tab to provide feedback. I will periodically create new
files to incorporate the changes and work if you as you'd like to.

I hope using this GitHub repository brings a sense of collaboration to the labs
and improves the overall quality of your skills development experience.

Regards,
